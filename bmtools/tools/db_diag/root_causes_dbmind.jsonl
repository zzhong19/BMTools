If the number of live and dead tuples in a table exceeds the tuple_number_threshold or the table size exceeds the table_total_size_threshold, then the table is considered large and added to the detail dictionary. If there are any large tables, then they are considered a root cause of performance issues. If there are no large tables, then they are not a root cause of performance issues.",
